**Library description:** The `sha256sum` library is a software library that provides an implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. It is used to generate a fixed-size, 256-bit (32-byte) hash from an input data of arbitrary length.

**Library use-cases:** The library is typically used for:

1. Data integrity checks: Ensuring that data has not been tampered with or corrupted during transmission or storage.
2. Password storage: Storing hashed versions of passwords, which can be compared to hashes of user input to verify correct passwords without storing the plaintext password.
3. Digital signatures: Verifying the authenticity of a message or document by checking the hash against a known value.
4. Cryptographic applications: Serving as a building block for various cryptographic protocols and schemes.

**Function description:** The `sha256_process_block` function processes a 512-bit (64-byte) block of input data as part of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. It updates the internal state of the hash function by applying a series of mathematical operations and bitwise manipulations to the input block and the current state. This function is typically called iteratively for each block of input data until the entire input has been processed, after which the final hash value can be extracted.

Here are some suggestions as to how you might optimize your system if `sha256_process_block` in `sha256sum` is consuming significant CPU resources:

1. **Use hardware acceleration:** Some modern CPUs and GPUs provide hardware support for SHA-256 hashing. Utilize these hardware accelerators to offload the computation and reduce CPU usage. For example, Intel's SHA Extensions (available in some Intel processors) can be used to speed up the hashing process. You can use libraries like Intel's [isa-l_crypto](https://github.com/intel/isa-l_crypto) that support hardware acceleration.

2. **Parallelize the hashing process:** If your application processes multiple independent data streams, you can parallelize the hashing process by using multiple threads or processes. This can help to better utilize available CPU cores and improve overall performance. Ensure that each thread or process has its own instance of the hash function to avoid race conditions.

3. **Optimize the input data processing:** If the input data can be preprocessed or compressed before hashing, it may reduce the number of calls to `sha256_process_block`, thus reducing CPU usage. For example, if you are hashing large files, consider using a faster, non-cryptographic hash function (e.g., xxHash or MurmurHash) to create smaller "fingerprints" of the data, and then hash these fingerprints using SHA-256.

4. **Batch processing:** If your application processes multiple small data inputs, consider batching them together into larger blocks before hashing. This can reduce the overhead of calling `sha256_process_block` multiple times for small inputs and improve overall performance.

5. **Consider alternative hashing algorithms:** If the security requirements of your application allow for it, you can consider using a faster hashing algorithm with lower CPU usage. For example, BLAKE2 is a cryptographic hash function that is often faster than SHA-256 on modern CPUs. You can use libraries like [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/hashing/generic_hashing) that provide an implementation of BLAKE2. However, ensure that the alternative algorithm meets your security requirements before making the switch.
